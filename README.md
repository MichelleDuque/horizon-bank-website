# Horizon Bank Website

This repository contains the source code for the Horizon Bank website, a digital banking platform built with HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript using the Bootstrap framework and GSAP for animations.

## Features

- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5 for compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.
- Modern and clean user interface.
- Interactive elements such as navigation bars and buttons.
- Integration of Google Fonts and Font Awesome for typography and icons.
- Animations powered by GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).
- Sass stylesheets for more maintainable and modular CSS code.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/MichelleDuque/horizon-bank-website.git
2. Install Sass if you haven't already. You can install it via npm: npm install -g sass
3. Compile the Sass files to CSS. Navigate to the `scss` directory and run: sass --watch main.scss:../css/main.css

This command will watch for changes in the `main.scss` file and automatically compile it to `main.css` in the `css` directory.

4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.

5. Optionally, you can modify the source code files in the `js` directory to customize the JavaScript functionality, and in the `scss` directory to customize the styles using Sass.
